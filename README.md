# Project 1 - Department of Veterans Affairs Analysis
San Diego is known as a military town. It is home to large bases across the Navy, Marines and Coast Guard. Many of San Diego's residents have served within the United States Armed Forces. In this project we will be exploring budget data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to determine how San Diego County compares to the rest of the country in veteran population and budget allocation across all VA programs. We will also be diving into the Disability Compensation program to uncover trends in veterans receiving disability and their relationship to budget allocation.

All Department of Veterans Affairs data has been sourced from data.gov. All budget numbers are in the thousands ($000â€™s). Veteran population numbers within the datasets are from the VA's own VetPop estimation model.
